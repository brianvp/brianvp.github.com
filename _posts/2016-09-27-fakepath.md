Had a good one today. Someone asked me at work why a file upload wasn't working on an old ASP intranet site. To be clear, the site doesn't actually upload a file, it merely stores a network share/path to the file, and presents a `file://` as a clickable link on a webpage.  Bad design yes, but good enough for it's purpose. 

The site worked in IE, but not in chrome, not too suprising, but I didn't know what the issue was.   I quickly threw up a [fiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/brnvndr/c2c4fruq/), and reproduced the behavior in chrome/firefox.  Here's what the different browsers displayed:

![File Input](/assets/file_input.PNG)

With the same HTML:

```html
<input id="fileInput" type=file name=attachment maxlength=200 size=40>
```

I did a little digging, seeing what I could extract from the file, when I noticed something curious.  `document.getElementById("fileInput").value` was returning `C:\fakepath\myFile.txt`  Ummm, what?

Well it turns out that the HTML5 folks **really** don't want the browser mucking about with the local file system.  This actually goes back several years, according to [this post from 2009](http://martinivanov.net/2009/06/09/the-mystery-of-cfakepath-unveiled/).   It's not a big deal though, I'll just re-write that intranet app...  

Thankfully it will work on IE, as long as this easy-to-configure setting is in place:

![Include Local Directory Path](/assets/include-local-directory-path.png)

The funny part is, if this is set to `disable`, the `<input>` will show the path as `c:\temp\myFile.txt`, but the actual value will be `c:\fakepath\myFile.txt`.

Frankly the better solution would be to simply return the file name without a real or fake path.  Firefox does this currently (try it out in the fiddle to see for yourself). I can understand the need to deprecate a feature, but if you are going to break something, don't return a quasi-real result.
